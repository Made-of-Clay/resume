            <p>I have a wonderful wife, an amazing son, and another son on the way! Much of the work I do is to provide the best, blessing-filled life for them that I can.</p>

            <p>As for me, I am a passionate learner who loves discovering new things, studying new topics, and marveling at how often seemingly-disparate topics and lesson overlap and mimic each other. A quick example of this is how Plato's Theory of Forms mimics object-oriented programming. To Plato, physical objects (objects) are only images (instances) of the truer forms (classes) they represent. A similar pattern is seen between blueprints or plans and an actual finished project. Who knew? (I am not the only one to recognize this, as a quick Google search will reveal, but being less novel does not make it less interesting.)</p>

            <p>My love of learning was discovered in college and has only grown since then. I have since come to favor the term <em>philomath</em> to describe this delightful condition of mine. Topics I tend to favor are philosophy, religion, linguistics, art, astronomy, history (especially Ancient Near East and Mediterranean, i.e. Greco-Roman, Jewish history), music (especially music theory), and technology as it relates to any of the preceeding. Most any other topic is of interest as well, but these are the ones I frequently return to.</p>

                <b>[*]</b> I am sensitive to how vague "web [app] developer" is, as well as "front-end" and "full stack" developer. I suspect it fascilitates flexibility in the work done as a front-end developer can focus on CSS (Sass/SCSS/LESS/Stylus) or Javascript (web games via Canvas &amp; formerly Flash, SPA frameworks like Vue, React, or Angular, etc...). Chris Coyier has a good post on <x-link href="https://css-tricks.com/job-titles-in-the-web-industry/" v-text="'CSS Tricks'" /> on this topic and it has come up on <x-link href="https://shoptalkshow.com/tag/job-titles/" v-text="'Shop Talk Show'" /> several times. Others in the web community have written or spoken on this too.
