# The personal website of Adam Leis

This functioned as my personal website for several years, especially during COVID when I was laid off and job hunting. I've moved it to a subdomain (resume.adamleis.com) to preserve the value of an interactive resume and make room for an updated personal website.

That being said, the current state of the site doesn't work because I don't have vue-cli installed. I need to update how it works so it builds correctly.
