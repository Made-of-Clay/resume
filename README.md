# Adam Leis - Dynamic Resume

This project is designed to do a few things:

1. provide a practice topic for new (to me) technologies, e.g., AstroJS
2. easily generate resume PDFs when job-hunting is a thing
3. use smart tech to handle the "work" of managing a resume

This readme (and Astro project) comes from [uzzii-21's astr-portfolio](https://github.com/uzzii-21/astro-portfolio/blob/master/README.md).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fonts
|   |   â””â”€â”€ images
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ general/
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Header.astro
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.astro
|   |       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   |   |â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ peojects.astro
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   |   |â”€â”€ custom-styles.css
â”‚   |   |â”€â”€ fonts.css
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ styles.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Astro looks for .astro or .md files in the src/pages/ directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about src/components/, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public/assets directory.

Your personal data would be go on src/data directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command              | Action                                       |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| npm install          | Installs dependencies                        |
| npm run dev          | Starts local dev server at localhost:3000    |
| npm run build        | Build your production site to ./dist/        |
| npm run preview      | Preview your build locally, before deploying |
| npm run astro ...    | Run CLI commands like astro add, astro check |
| npm run astro --help | Get help using the Astro CLI                 |
